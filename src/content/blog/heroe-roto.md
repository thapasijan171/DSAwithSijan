Joseph Campbell proposed a narrative structure that is still relevant today and can be identified in almost any story. Movies, Novels, Plays, whatever form a story is told, it can be based on this structure.

This scheme is known as the Monomyth or Hero's Journey, which Joseph presented through his work, *The Hero with a Thousand Faces* (1947).

## Have you seen Star Wars Episode IV?​

This is a clear example of the hero's journey, which consists of 12 stages that our protagonist must go through during his adventure.

And after completing this journey, he returns home transformed.

In the case of Luke Skywalker, the protagonist lives in his ordinary world when he receives a call to adventure.

When he encounters two droids that show him a hologram asking for help.

This eventually leads him to meet Obi-Wan, who will serve as a mentor for our protagonist to complete his journey.

## What is a Broken Hero?​

The broken hero narrative, also known as the Old Man, is a recent archetype, so to speak, popularized by comics such as *The Dark Knight Returns*, *Old Man Logan*, among others.

But these examples can not only be found in comic book characters, but also in movies like *The Incredibles* or *Hook*, where we see an adult Peter Pan who left "Neverland" to lead an ordinary life and start a family.

And it is precisely the stories that use the Old Man archetype that tell us about a hero who left the mantle long ago and for whom the years have passed.

Here, our hero received a call to adventure, completed his journey, and returned home transformed, but did not get the happy ending he expected.

## Guilt

>In *The Dark Knight Returns*, Batman decides to leave the mantle after the death of Jason Todd — the second Robin — at the hands of the Joker.

Wolverine, after being manipulated by Mysterio, kills all his companions, believing they were enemies attacking the X-Mansion.

Realizing the deception and seeing that everyone died by his own claws, Wolverine swears never to use them again in his life.

In these two examples, we can see that the reason our heroes abandon their path as superheroes is due to guilt, but above all because they have concluded that their fight is not worth it.

But our heroes can also leave the mantle due to exile or because society has turned its back on them.

They are forced to completely disappear from the public eye.

We can see a clear example with Mr. Incredible in the movie *The Incredibles*, who is sued by the person he saves, as "he didn't want to be saved." This leads to a series of protests that finally result in the prohibition of superheroes.

Superman, on the other hand, resorts to self-exile in the comic *Kingdom Come*. After Joker kills Lois Lane and other members of *The Daily Planet*, Superman searches for Joker to turn him over to the law. However, a new superhero named Magog finds Joker first and decides to kill him.

Superman turns Magog over to the authorities, but they let him go. When Superman sees that people have lost the values he used to defend, he decides to exile himself in the Fortress of Solitude.

## A New Call to Adventure

>When our hero decides to leave the mantle, they try to adapt to society, leading a peaceful life, but often accompanied by deep depression.

Deep down, our hero misses his alter ego and nostalgically remembers the glory days.

In Peter Pan's case, the story is different, as upon leaving "Neverland," he began to grow up and, over the years, forgot all his adventures, friends (the Lost Boys), and Tinkerbell.

Batman has also aged, becoming an alcoholic and risking his life in car races.

Mr. Incredible now lives as an employee and father, who sneaks out with his friend and former superhero Frozone to listen to police radios, discussing whether they should intervene.

Once again, our heroes find themselves in their ordinary world when they receive a new call to adventure.

But this new call is sometimes something they must take because they have no other choice but to put on the suit again.

Wolverine has to embark on a journey to get the money the Hulk's children are demanding, to protect his family.

Peter Pan is forced to travel back to "Neverland" when Hook kidnaps his children.

Batman decides to return because he can no longer silence the voice in his head, and due to the growing wave of crime from the mutant gang, as well as the uncontrollable return of Two-Face.

## The World Is No Longer the Same

>The years have passed, and not only has our hero changed, but the world is now different.

These stories often present us with a post-apocalyptic world where crime has risen due to the absence of heroes, and people's values have completely changed.

Our heroes have also changed in their personalities, now much darker, willing to surpass their limits but also conditioned by their advanced age, which in a way makes them more vulnerable to attacks.

In the *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* comic, **"The Last Ronin"**, Michelangelo continues his fight and revenge after the death of his brothers.

Now with a darker personality, leaving jokes behind and being willing to kill.

Even after being defeated, he attempts to commit **seppuku** (a samurai ritual where warriors commit suicide to preserve their honor) using Leonardo's sword.

But he fails to complete it as he loses consciousness from losing too much blood.

We have another example with an elderly Batman, who is no longer as stealthy as before, and his fights leave him with severe injuries. He even says, "Sometimes I've survived purely by luck."

Batman has to be more strategic when fighting the mutant leader, who beat him in their first confrontation.

In the movie *Logan*, Wolverine has not only lost much of his healing power, but the adamantium coating his skeleton and claws is poisoning him, so it will eventually kill him.

![Logan](/img/img_blog/logan.webp)

Mr. Incredible, on the other hand, has lost his shape, now carrying extra weight, and has to start training again to handle his missions.

Now with a family, he has much more to lose. Although this story isn't very dark, as it's a movie aimed at a younger audience, it perfectly serves as an example of the passing of time on our protagonist.

Because, in the end, that's what these stories are about.

![Bob (Mr. Incredible) training](/img/img_blog/BobEntrenando.gif)

Peter Pan will have to remember who he is and believe again to regain his powers because that's what it takes to rescue his children.

This is difficult for him since his adult life has only destroyed his dreams and aspirations.

## Why Do We Love These Stories So Much?

We're used to seeing stories where our heroes seem never to age, and as we grow up, we leave many things behind, including some fictional characters.

This is because these characters have reached such fame and popularity that they must remain relevant through the years.

That's why Old Man stories generally occur in another Earth or timeline, where writers have complete creative freedom to develop their characters and show us what their lives would be like if time had passed for them.

One of the main reasons we love these types of stories is, therefore, the fact that we can relate to our heroes once again.

We empathize with them, and at the same time, it sparks our curiosity to know what has become of them.

We go from being children to being adults, so seeing these stories gives us a feeling of nostalgia, like when you meet a friend after many years without seeing them.

## What Is the Positive Message of These Stories?

As I said earlier, Broken Hero stories are often dark, where our protagonist has suffered great defeats, losses, and disappointments. A hero who never got his happy ending and lost his faith in humanity.

But despite that, they are able to reignite the flame that once burned intensely and now seemed extinguished.

Our hero can fight once more for his ideals and pass the mantle to a new generation.

And that's the positive side of the Broken Hero: getting back up one more time, despite life's beatings, and despite the years having taken their toll. Once again, they become glorious.
