This theme comes with the integration [@astrojs / mdx] (https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) installed and configured in your configuration file `astro.config.mjs`. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable the support by removing the integration from your configuration file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special variant of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This allows you to [mix JavaScript and user interface components into your Markdown content] (https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive graphics or alerts.

If you have existing content written in MDX, this integration will make migration to Astro very easy.

## Example

Here we show you how to import and use a user interface component within MDX. 
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the interactive button below.

import HeaderLink from '../../components/HeaderLink.astro';

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
		Component embedded in MDX
</HeaderLink>

- ** Note: ** [Customer Directives] (https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still necessary to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will be rendered as static HTML (without JavaScript) by default.
